This is the repo for my custom keyboards that use ZMK firmware. I have a an Atreus 62 based on the PCB from [Profet Keyboards](https://shop.profetkeyboards.com/product/atreus62-pcb), and an ergodox that also uses [their pcb](https://shop.profetkeyboards.com/product/ergodox-pcbs). Both use versions of the [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/) microcontroller, which is pinout compatible with pro micro boards.
